## Host/Provider System Requirements:
### DIY Linux
| Software | Usage                                                                |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OpenSSH  | Allows connection to server if using SSH. (SSH Default port is `22`) |
| CURL     | CURL allows for api requests to be sent to the host.                 |
### DIY Windows
| Software | Usage                                                                | Software Location                                                                               |

| OpenSSH  | Allows connection to server if using SSH. (SSH Default port is `22`) | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse |
| CURL     | CURL allows for api requests to be sent to the host.                 | https://curl.haxx.se/download.html                                                              |

Please Note: If using Windows as your host/provider you will need to configure openSSH as it not
configured or installed.

## System Ports
The system requires access to port `8016` (this can be changed) however is the default port for accessing
the main user interface.

Port `1932` is also a required port and at this point can not be changed as is used to communicate
with the server/api part of the monitor tool.

## Docker Recommended Port Configuration
Please **_do not change internal ports or external port `1932`_**, as this will break the system.

| Docker Layout | Usage                                             | External | Internal |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| 8016:80       | Main web interface (external port can be changed) | 8016     | 80       |
| 1932:1932     | Backend communication (do not change)             | 1932     | 1932     |

## Initial Login
Once SCPrime Monitor has been set up and the database installed you can log in using the
following initial credentials:
- **Username:** admin@domain.com
- **Password:** qwertyuiop

If this is the fist time logging in it will ask you to enter your new credentials to configure
your account on the system.

## Compatability
Below is a table of the current host (storage provider) compatability list.

| Operating System | Status                                                                          | Plans        |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| DIY Linux        | Fully Compatible                                                                |              |
| DIY Windows      | Fully Compatible                                                                |              |
| DIY Docker       | Can use the linux option if the container is running on same network (untested) | Coming Soon  |
| DIY Apple        | No support officially, this is due to lack of interest on the network           | Coming Later |
| XA Miner         | Currently no way of communicating with the hosts API                            | Coming Soon  |

## Known Issues
- Currently, there is no support for any other SSH authentication except password. This will be 
patched in an upcoming update where we will introduce SSH Key Pairs.

- Updated server to allow apple connections.
- Locked down Storage Per TB/Month and Collateral Per TB/Month to numbers between 1 and 5 SCP.

#### Fixed Bugs
- Fixed an issue that caused the Auto Announce system to get stuck and never run again.
- Fixed a bug in the admin area preventing users from being displayed.
- Background tasks were getting stuck after initial execution.
- Investigating a connection issue with Ubuntu Desktop (20.04).
- Fixed a bug on the currency conversion calculator that makes the system think 1 Hash = 1 SCP.
